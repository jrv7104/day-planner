This is a daily planner that I developed with some help. While I was able to get the general framework of the program set up, I did get some assistance with getting some functions and the display date to work. 

The main differences between this and the provided example are the highlighted sections for the past, present and future sections and the save buttons. The provided example has each row highlighted appropriately. I was able to get the text box to update the color instead of the entire row. The save button was also a bit different than the provided example. My biggest goal in this task and every task in this coding boot camp is to make sure the website functions accurately. Updated designs for completed projects could be a possibility for me down the road once I gain more knowledge and confidence.
